*HOW IT IS DONE*:
THIS TASK WAS DONE BY USING THE "VGG-19" MODEL TO EXTRACT BOTH THE IMAGE AND ALSO THE IMAGE STYLE, SO BASICALLY THE USER NEEDS TO PROVIDE BOTH THE IMAGES THE MAIN IMAGE AND ALSO STYLE IMAGE IN WHICH YOUR IMAGE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.WE ACHIEVED THIS USING PYTORCH AND THE PRE-TRAINED VGG-19 MODEL. VGG-19 WAS USED TO EXTRACT FEATURES FROM DIFFERENT CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS, CAPTURING BOTH THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONTENT IMAGE AND THE TEXTURES OF THE STYLE IMAGE.
